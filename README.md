# Impressively Pointless Wikipedia Headline Collection Tool
This program is pointless, so pointless infact that, one would find it incredibly impressive, this README file is almost just as pointless.
## Scope
The scope of this project: 
* Collect random headline from the English Wikipedia
* Add comment in mixed English and Danish
  * This is based on the presence of italics or the lack thereof
* Upload to database
